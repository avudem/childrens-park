This is a Jabber/Gtalk bot written using the python-jabberbot library.
This bot is written to behave like a chatroom, where all the messages
are sent to all the subscribed users. 

+ You are required to have a file settings.py with the variables, JID,
  PASSWORD, CHANNEL, RES

+ Depends: python-jabberbot, xmpppy

+ To add new users, the admin can either add them manually to a USERS
  dict in a state.py file, or they can be invited and then added.

+ *Known Issue*: Google doesn't allow sending and receiving more than
  50 messages in a period of 12.5 seconds.  This is a big problem if
  you have even three or four members in the channel.  Use jabber.org
  for hosting the bot, instead.
