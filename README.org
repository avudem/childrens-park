This is a Jabber/Gtalk bot written using the python-jabberbot library.
This bot is written to behave like a chatroom, where all the messages
are sent to all the subscribed users. 

You are required to have a file settings.py with the variables, JID,
PASSWORD, CHANNEL, RES

Depends: python-jabberbot, xmpppy

To add new users, the admin can either add them manually to a USERS
dict in a users.py file, or they can be invited and then added.
